#This project is a part of my Internship at Digit(India's No.1 Technology Magazine) and will be an integral part of digit.in which has approximately 20 million visitors/month.

The aim of this project is to facilitate sellers visiting ‘digit.in’ to add information of their products that they wish to sell via ‘digit.in’. The seller gets his own dashboard fully loaded with features. Some of the features in are listed as below : 

1) Insert/Delete a Product. 
2) Insert/Delete a Category. 
3) Insert/Delete a Brand. 
4) View Customers,Orders and Payments. 
 
Furthermore for checking the authenticity of the seller we track the current location of the seller using an API. Moreover, we have implemented autosuggestion on the Insert Product Page to enhance the User Experience. This autosuggestion suggests the name of the product the seller wishes to add and the only work the seller has to do is to fill in the Product Price and the Stock/Availability.
